## Installation

The good news is that, you are no longer required to depend on Sam Hewitt's and other Suru++ packs.

### PPA (Ubuntu and Debian-derived)

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install suru-plus-pack

## Bugs and reports

### Many apps are not well displayed

It is not the pack's problem. It is the desktop files problem because:
* Snap apps are very buggy and can't be open and as Gnome-Characters, Gnome-Logs, Gravit Designer and Vectr, use the different path and use the ICO/PNG extension added instead;
* The desktop files of certain native apps as IBus and Mozc for Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages use the different relative path of an icon, use the PNG format added a SVG extension, turn the icons unrecognisable by the icons packs,

We have already reported these issues:
* CrossFTP: 
* GitHub Desktop: [view the issue](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/issues/42#issuecomment-387865477)
* Gravit Designer: [view the issue](https://discuss.gravit.io/t/linux-package-feature-requests/294/20)
* IBus: [view the issue](https://github.com/phuang/ibus-pinyin/issues/13)
* Mozc Setup: [view the issue](https://github.com/google/mozc/issues/440)

We provide desktop files (AppImage, native Debian packages, snap app and source codes) for you for being able of opening the apps and displaying well the icons. You can download them from  <a href="https://github.com/Magog64/SURU-PLUS/tree/master/desktop">Suru++</a>. Copy them to `your_name/local/applications/`, so they won't be affected or modified when you make next updates of Ubuntu and/or PPAs.

We recommend you to back your files up when you intend to make a clean install or reinstall your distribution.
